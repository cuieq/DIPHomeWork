TIFFReadRawStrip(3)                         TIFFReadRawStrip(3)





NAME
       TIFFReadRawStrip  -  return  the undecoded contents of a
       strip of data from an open TIFF file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tiffio.h>
       tsize_t  TIFFReadRawStrip(TIFF*  tif,  tstrip_t   strip,
       tdata_t buf, tsize_t size)

DESCRIPTION
       Read  the contents of the specified strip into the (user
       supplied) data buffer.  Note that the value of strip  is
       a  ``raw  strip number.''  That is, the caller must take
       into account whether or not the  data  is  organized  in
       separate planes (PlanarConfiguration=2).  To read a full
       strip of data the data buffer  should  typically  be  at
       least  as large as the number returned by TIFFStripSize.

RETURN VALUES
       The actual number of bytes of data that were  placed  in
       buf  is  returned; TIFFReadEncodedStrip returns -1 if an
       error was encountered.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error messages are directed to the TIFFError(3) rou-
       tine.
